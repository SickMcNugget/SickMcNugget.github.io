# NFDUMP
nfdump is a program that allows the collection of network flows (either sFlow or netflow) from a capable switch. The problem is, I want to use this program on a system that does not have the capability to build the software, and it may be missing the required libraries. This post is here simply to help me build this software.

## Prerequisite - librrd
For debian, just do:
```bash
sudo apt install librrd-dev # Gets the static archive
```

## Prerequisite - libpcap
By default, libpcap produces a static archive when building it, so the following commands are all that is needed.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/the-tcpdump-group/libpcap.git 
pushd libpcap
./autogen.sh && ./configure && make && sudo make install
popd
```

## nfdump - Still doesnt quite work as of yet
```bash
git clone https://github.com/phaag/nfdump.git
pushd nfdump
./autogen
./configure --enable-shared=no --enable-sflow --enable-nfpcapd --enable-nfprofile --enable-nftrack --enable-nsel --enable-maxmind --enable-tor --enable-ja4
make
make install
```
